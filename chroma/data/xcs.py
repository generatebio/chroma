"""XCS represents protein structure as a tuple of PyTorch tensors.

The tensors in an XCS representation are:

    `X` (FloatTensor), the Cartesian coordinates representing the protein
        structure with shape `(num_batch, num_residues, num_atoms, 3)`. The
        `num_atoms` dimension can be one of two sizes: `num_atoms=4` for
        backbone-only structures or `num_atoms=14` for all-atom structures
        (excluding hydrogens). The first four atoms will always be
        `N, CA, C, O`, and the meaning of the optional 10 additional atom
        positions will vary based on the residue identity at
        a given position. Atom orders for each amino acid are defined in
        `constants.AA_GEOMETRY[TRIPLET_CODE]["atoms"]`.

    `C` (LongTensor), the chain map encoding per-residue chain assignments with
        shape `(num_batch, num_residues)`.The chain map codes positions as `0`
        when masked, positive integers for chain indices, and negative integers
        to represent missing residues (of the corresponding positive integers).

    `S` (LongTensor), the sequence of the protein as alphabet indices with
        shape `(num_batch, num_residues)`. The standard alphabet is
        `ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY`, also defined in `constants.AA20`.
